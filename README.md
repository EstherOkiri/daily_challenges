# Daily Challenge 2
    Sum of numbers between 1 and ‘n’
    Write a program that takes a positive integer n as input and outputs 
    the sum of all numbers between 1 and n that are divisible by 3 or 5 (or both).

    For example, if n is 15, the program should output 45, since the numbers 
    between 1 and 15 that are divisible by 3 or 5 are: 3, 5, 6, 9, and 10, and their sum is 45.

    Here are some additional requirements and hints:
- Use a loop to iterate over all the numbers between 1 and n.
- Use an if statement and the modulus operator (%) to check if a number is divisible by 3 or 5.
- Use a variable to keep track of the running sum, and update it on each iteration of the loop.
- You can assume that the input n will be a positive integer.

# Daily Challenge 3 - Fibonacci Sequence
# Fibonacci Sequence
  Create a function called fibonacci_sequence that takes in an integer n as its parameter and 
  returns a list of the first n numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.

# Daily Challenge 4 - 
# Group By
  Write a function called groupBy that takes two parameters: an array of objects and a string that represents a property name. The function should group the objects in the array by the value of the specified property, and return an object where each key is the distinct value of the specified property, and the value is an array of objects that have that property value.
